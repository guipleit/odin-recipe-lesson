    <p>"This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe
        card,
        this was a family favorite."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour
            in the milk,
            egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
